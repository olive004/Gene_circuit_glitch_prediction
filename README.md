# Gene circuit failure

Predicting alternative steady states that may arise in a heterologous gene circuit from perturbations.

## Usage

### Docker

If you want to start the docker container, follow these steps.

1. From your terminal, change directories to be inside the home directory of this project.
2. Run the setup/start_docker.sh using bash, eg `bash setup/startup_docker.sh`. If you run this from another directory, the docker container will simply contain all the folder in the directory you ran this command from rather than only containing the folders within the scope of this project.
