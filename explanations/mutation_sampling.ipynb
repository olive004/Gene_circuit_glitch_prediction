    "# Sampling the sequence space for mutations\n",
    "\n",
    "In biological sequence spaces (DNA, RNA, and proteins), the possible search space is vast and high dimensional. The further a biological sequence mutates away from its original sequence, the more unpredictable the final behavior of the system becomes, with mutations often layering on top of each other at the sequence level in a way that translates non-linearly to the higher order structures - the phenomenon of epistasis. To explore the local mutational landscape required sampling both a well-chosen set of starting sequences and sufficient sampling in their surroundings. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finding good starting sequences has a few caveats. The goal of genetic circuits is to actuate some behavior through the interactions of its components in response to a signal. Therefore, sequences that have combinations of weak or strong interactions are desirable. However, the vast majority of sequence space has weak interactions and is thus non-functional, meaning pairs of sequences have extremely weak binding. Finding sequences that can bind to each other strongly is a prerequisite, but the total sampling of the possible circuit space should still be diverse enough to capture many different types of circuits.\n",
