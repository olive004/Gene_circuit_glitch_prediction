# Galaxy tool shed integration (Zaher Wanli)

You will find the wrapper in this folder, after Björn merges my PR.

You will need to install PLanemo for linting and testing the wrappers.

You can find basic information about writing a wrapper here:

And for more details and information you can always refer to the Galaxy
documentation, it's easy to read and very helpful.
