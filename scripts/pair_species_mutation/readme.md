# Purpose

The purpose of 'pair_species_mutation' is to generate a number of RNA circuits, where the length of each RNA sequence is uniform and specified in the config file, along with the number of species.

## Circuit generation

The circuits are generated by first generating a 'template' RNA species randomly, with the abundances of nucleotides set to match that of E. coli K-12 [Blattner et al. 1997](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.277.5331.1453?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed):
- G (26.22%)
- C (24.58%)
- A (24.52%)
- T (24.69%)

Once the template has been generated,
