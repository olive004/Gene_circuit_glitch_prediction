# Purpose

The purpose of 'pair_species_mutation' is to generate a number of RNA circuits, where the length of each RNA sequence is uniform and specified in the config file, along with the number of species.

## Circuit generation

The circuits are generated by first generating a 'template' RNA species randomly, with the abundances of nucleotides set to match that of E. coli K-12 [Blattner et al. 1997](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.277.5331.1453?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed):

- G (26.22%)
- C (24.58%)
- A (24.52%)
- T (24.69%)

The template is the species that has been selected to be the input signal (via name in signal config). Once the template has been generated, the remaining RNA species are generated as mutated versions of the template. There are several ways in which this can happen, which are captured within the RNAGenerator class attribute 'generate_circuit' through the options:

1. 'random': Random string sequence generated with weighted characters
2. 'template_mix': Mix between 'template_mutate' and 'template_split'. A template sequence is interleaved with complementary characters
3. 'template_mutate': A template sequence is mutated according to weighted characters
4. 'template_split': Parts of a template sequence are made complementary

## Mutations

Once the RNA sequence of all circuit species have been determined, the circuit can be initialised by simulating the interaction energies between the species and finding their steady state counts after initialisation with an initial amount.
